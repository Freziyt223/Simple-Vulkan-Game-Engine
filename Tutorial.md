So, you want to know how this works, firstly, i recomend checking the [Vulkan Tutorial site](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) for official information.
But for C tutorial, i recommend checking the CODOTAKU tutorial series: [Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlKj-4rp1Gz0eBLIcq2wzd8uigFrJduJ-)
also, if you want to learn on my code, here is the guider,
firstly check out the Program, Include and Engine files, to understand what is being initialized in total, then check Window.h, Instance.h and then Surface.h and only then Device.h this chain will help you understand what is happening and what is being initialized in order. Then goes the Swapchain.h, recommend to check Program.h sometimes to understand which type are the variables and what is giving program the sense. 
After that goes Render, firstly, i compiled 2 files for vertex and fragment shader in Render/Shader foulder(using glslc/shaderc from Google) with -mfmt=c so output will be more like C array, then i put the code that got out into Shader.h file into ShaderVertex and ShaderFragment(kind of messy, but that is just for test and tutorial purposes), then go to Render.h and understand what actually is render and what does graphical pipeline do with the help of official wiki and vulkan tutorial site.
